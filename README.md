# Pymaceuticals_Inc_Challenge
Module 5 Challenge- applying what I've learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.


**Background:**

I have just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, I have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked me for a top-level summary of the study results.

**Instructions:**

This assignment is broken down into a number of tasks found below:

- Prepare the data.

- Generate summary statistics.

- Create bar charts and pie charts.

- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

- Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

- Calculate correlation and regression.

- Submit your final analysis.

**Final Analysis:**

**Observations: **

1) There is a positive correlation between tumor volume and weight.

In this particular study tumor volume and weight are positively correlated, the plots are showing changes in tumor size that are accompanied by corresponding changes in weight. What this means is that successful treatment leading to tumor regression may also result in weight loss, while tumor progression could coincide with weight gain. 
Positive correlations observed in animal studies may have implications for human cancer patients, informing clinical trial design and therapeutic strategies. 

2) The gender population distribution was almost perfectly balanced.

A balanced sample reduces the risk of bias by ensuring that gender-specific factors are equally represented. This balance allows researchers to explore the impact of other variables or treatments more effectively, without the confounding influence of gender imbalance.

3) The most successful treatments are Capomulin and Ramicane. 

Based on the data provided these two treatments have been the most successful in reducing tumor volume in the test subjects. These treatments also have a lower standard deviation compared to other treatments in the study.

**Further Research:** 

I feel that it would be important to study the age of the mouse and the success of the treatments. 

The age of the mouse could provide valuable insights in tumor testing by showing the effectiveness of treatments since the age of the mouse might influence how well the tumore responds to the treatments.  Younger mice may have a more robust immune system or could be more resilient to side effects compared to their older counterparts.
